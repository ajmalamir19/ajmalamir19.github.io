              <p><strong>Personal background:</strong> Originating from Afghanistan, I ventured to Charlotte in 2019, bringing with me a unique cultural blend. My journey has been marked by the joy of raising two wonderful daughters: Aisha, an energetic 7-year-old, and Ramisa, a bright 3-year-old. I am happily married to just one wife yet. (lol I just said this to make you laugh; I love my wife). Embracing this vibrant city since my arrival, I've found a welcoming community to call home.</p>

              <p><strong>Academic Background:</strong> As a lifelong learner, I am driven by the adage "from the cradle to the grave, gain knowledge." This journey led me to begin my higher education at CPCC in 2020, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC). This academic pursuit is not just about acquiring knowledge; it's a commitment to personal and professional growth. My diverse background and experiences, as well as the comprehensive curriculum at UNCC, provide a solid foundation for contributing effectively in the field of technology and software engineering.</p>
