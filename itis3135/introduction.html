              <p><strong>Personal background:</strong> Originating from Afghanistan, I ventured to Charlotte in 2019, bringing with me a unique cultural blend. My journey has been marked by the joy of raising two wonderful daughters: Aisha, an energetic 7-year-old, and Ramisa, a bright 3-year-old. I am happily married to just one wife yet. (lol I just said this to make you laugh; I love my wife). Embracing this vibrant city since my arrival, I've found a welcoming community to call home.</p></li>
